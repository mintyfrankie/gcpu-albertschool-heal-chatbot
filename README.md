# gcpu-albert-hackathon

WIP project for the GCPU Hackathon deliverable.

## Setup

I will recommend `rye` for the package manager and virtual environment management.

Execute the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
rye sync
```

Then you can run the app with:

```bash
rye run streamlit src/app.py
```

You will have to set up the environment variables in `.env`.
