    <response>
        Hi! For pain that has lasted a week, it would be best to see a general practitioner first. They can assess your situation and, if necessary, recommend a physiotherapist or another specialist. 
        
        While waiting for your appointment, try to rest and avoid strenuous physical activity. An over-the-counter anti-inflammatory can also help relieve the pain - your pharmacist can advise you on the best options. 
        
        If the pain becomes more intense or if you notice additional symptoms, like numbness or difficulty moving, it would be wise to consult a doctor promptly. I'm here if you have more questions or if you need help finding a doctor!
